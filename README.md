# CS2640-Final-Project
They call me Julius the way I Caesar 


Idea for what the code should look like:

- macro that transfers letters to numbers (a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, etc.)
- macro that transfers numbers to letters (1 = a, 2 = b, 3 = c, etc.) if the number is greater than 26, subtract 26 until you get a number below 26
- macro that turns the input string into a number array using the first macro
- macro that turns a number array into a string using the second macro
- macro that uses user input number and adds that input number to every num in the array

program work order:

1. ask user for string input (message)
2. ask user for offset number input (caesar shift)
3. convert each letter into a number on the array
4. add input number to each number in the array
5. convert numbers in the array to new letter in string
6. print string
